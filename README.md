# Coding Assignment  

Control System Simulation

## Objective:

Your task is to develop a simulation for a Control System. The simulation will be used to control the temperature and pressure of a machine. The machine has two sensors that provide real-time readings of the temperature and pressure. The machine also has two parameters that can be adjusted to control the temperature and pressure. The goal of the simulation is to control the temperature and pressure of the machine by adjusting the parameters based on the sensor readings.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the latest version of Python.

2. Install a C++ compiler. If you're using Windows, you can install MinGW. If you're using macOS, you can install the Xcode command line tools. If you're using Linux, you can install the `g++` package using your package manager.

3. Clone this repository to your local machine.

4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

5. Create the Shared library using `g++ -m64 -shared -o control_system.dll control_system.cpp -lpthread`.

7. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. Run the python file using `python control_system.py`

You should see the following graph showing the real-time simulated temperature and pressure values of the system. However, as you can observe, as there is no control system implemented yet, the temperature and pressure values are not being controlled.

## Requirements:

### C++ Component 

Develop the core simulation engine in C++.

- You are provided a starting point in the file `control_system.cpp`.

- There are classes to model the Sensors, Controllers, and Control System. You may modify these classes as necessary, or add new classes depending on your solution.

- You may modify the model to generate the temperature and pressure sensor values in `run()`.

- Implement real-time control mechanisms to adjust machine parameters based on sensor inputs in the function `control()`. You may modify the PID controller as necessary, or implement a different controller.

- Implement multi-threading in your simulation, with one thread handling sensor input, another handling the PID controller, and another handling parameter adjustment.

### Python Component

Develop a Python interface for the simulation engine.

- You are provided a starting point in the file `control_system.py`. This file imports the C++ Shared library, calls the `run()` function and displays the sensor readings and machine parameters in real-time using matplotlib.

- Implement functionality to start, stop, and pause the simulation from the Python interface. You may choose any visualization libraries like PySide6, PyQt5, or Tkinter to implement the interface.

- Allow the user to set the parameters for the system (e.g., target temperature, target pressure) and modify them during the simulation which will be reflected in the C++ simulation engine and the control system should adapt accordingly.

- Display real-time updates of the sensor readings and machine parameters over time during the simulation.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Correctness and completeness of the simulation.

- Use of object-oriented principles in the design of the simulation engine.

- Efficiency of the real-time control mechanisms.

- Usability and functionality of the Python interface.

- Quality of the code (including readability, comments, and adherence to coding standards).

- Handling of potential errors or exceptional conditions in the system.

- You may choose to work more on the C++ component or the Python component depending on your strengths and the job role you are applying for. However, you are expected to have a basic understanding of both components.
